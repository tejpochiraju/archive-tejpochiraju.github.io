So, I built a [new portfolio website](https://tejpochiraju.in). I learnt a lot of HTML and CSS while discovering some great new tools along the way. The biggest win though was the opportunity to document projects going back 14 years and reflect on successes and failures.

# Need

- Document work over 14 years and reflect on successes and failures
- Showcase successes and failures to allow open, credible conversations

# Idea

- Build a content management system that is easy to maintain and update as I work on new projects
- Read projects from Excel/CSV since I maintain a list of projects in Google Sheets 
- Multiple views and filters to see projects based on arena (academia, corporate, startup), status (abandoned, prototype, released) and contribution (mostly design and development but also some writing and supply chain identification)

# Technology

- Jekyll because it can be hosted on Github Pages and because it generates themed static HTML pages
- Bulma.io - because it is complete and speeds up development
