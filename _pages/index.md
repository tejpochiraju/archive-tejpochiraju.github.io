## Hi! I am Dr. Tej Pochiraju - 
a consultant product innovator based in Bangalore, India. I have been lucky enough to work with numerous nimble startups and SMEs as well market-leaders such as Datamars, Texon and Mondelez.

I love building new products that combine hardware and software to solve real world challenges - like [environmental sustainability](/tag/energy/) or low cost [communications](/tag/electronics/). Stints in [academia](/tag/academia/), [corporates](/tag/corporate/) and [startup-land](/tag/startup/) have allowed me to work across technology readiness levels.

Many of the projects have [gone into the market](/tag/released/) with success. See a full classification of the [projects here](/filter/).

I am affiliated with:

- [Sustain](http://jaagasustain.in): CEO of this product innovation studio for environmental ventures
- [Jaaga Startup](http://startup.jaaga.in): Partner at this curated coworking space focused on skill sharing amongst entrepreneurs
