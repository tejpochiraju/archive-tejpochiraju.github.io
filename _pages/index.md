---

## Thanks for stopping by
I am Tej Pochiraju, PhD - a consultant product innovator based in Bangalore, India. I have worked on over 50 product development projects with over half reaching (& surviving!) [the market](/tag/released/). Teams I have been lucky enough to work with include numerous nimble startups and SMEs as well market-leaders such as Datamars, Texon and Mondelez.

I love building new products that combine hardware and software to solve real world challenges - like [environmental sustainability](/tag/energy/) or low cost [communications](/tag/electronics/). Stints in [academia](/tag/academia/), [corporates](/tag/corporate/) and [startup-land](/tag/startup/) have allowed me to work across technology readiness levels.
