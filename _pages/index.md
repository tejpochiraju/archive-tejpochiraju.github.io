title: Iterative Product Developer
---

## Thanks for stopping by

I am Tej Pochiraju, PhD - an iterative product developer based in Bangalore, India. I have worked on over 50 product development projects with over half reaching (& surviving!) [the market](/tag/released/). Teams I have been lucky enough to work with include numerous nimble startups and SMEs as well market-leaders such as Social Alpha, Meghshala, Joovv and Datamars.

I love building new products that increase productivity and improve communication. Stints in [academia](/tag/academia/), [corporates](/tag/corporate/) and [startup-land](/tag/startup/) have allowed me to work across technology readiness levels.

See a full classification of the [projects here](/filter/). You can also download my [1 page resume (PDF)](/assets/resume_tej_pochiraju.pdf).

### Organisations I run

- [Jaaga Study](https://jaaga.in/study): Building product builders through bootcamps, apprenticeships and hands-on projects.
- [Jaaga Startup](http://jaaga.in/startup): Curated, affordable coworking for entrepreneurs open to collaborative skill sharing.
