# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hi, I am Dr. Tej Pochiraju - a consultant product innovator based in Bangalore, India. I am privileged to have worked with numerous nimble startups and SMEs as well market-leaders such as Datamars, Texon and Mondelez.

  I love building new products that combine hardware and software to solve real world challenges - like environmental sustainability or low cost communications. Stints in academia, corporates and startup-land have allowed me to work at all technology readiness levels.

  I am affiliated with:

  - Sustain: CEO of this product innovation studio for environmental ventures
